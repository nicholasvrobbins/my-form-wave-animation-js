Live Demo:

Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript.

Today we made a login form with text that animates upon clicking into the input field. Mostly used CSS for this one but did get a chance to utilize some cool JavaScript methods I've been recently learning about, specifically .split which split each letter into it's own array, .map which allowed us to add a transition-delay to each individual letter and then .join to bring it all back together. I think this was my first time using those in a project so that's exciting to see them changing the DOM as opposed to just doing algorithm questions. Also in CSS, I don't believe I've used the :active pseudo-class before but used transform to scale down the button on click to 95% size which is a great responsive way of showing feedback, will be utilizing that in the future, also used a cubic-bezier for the transition animation effect which I'm intrigued with using more, it's very fun to play around with. Overall, again a simple but fun project, could see something similar to this being utilized for logging into an app/website.
